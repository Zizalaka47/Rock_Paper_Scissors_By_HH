# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Title
Rock_Paper_Scissors_By_HH

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive command-line game where the user can play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. This project aims to provide an example of basic Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

## Solution
The problem is solved by using Python's built-in libraries and simple control structures. The game allows the player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and compares the player's choice with the computer's random choice to determine the winner. The following technologies and libraries are used:

- Python 3
- `random` library for generating the computer's choice

Alternatively, you can run the game on your local machine by following these steps:

1. Download the source code from the provided link.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file.
4. Run the game by executing the following command:
    ```sh
    python Rock_Paper_Scissors_By_HH.py
    ```

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs
- The user is prompted to choose `[r]ock`, `[p]aper`, or `[s]cissors`.

### Outputs
- The game displays the user's choice and the computer's choice.
- After each round, the game asks the user if he/she want to play again. If the user chooses to continue, the game repeats. If the user chooses to stop, the game displays the final result showing the total number of wins for the player and the computer.
