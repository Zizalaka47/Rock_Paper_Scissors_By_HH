# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Project Title
BreadcrumbsRock_Paper_Scissors_By_HH

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive command-line game where the user can play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. This project aims to provide an example of basic Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

## Solution
The problem is solved by using Python's built-in libraries and simple control structures. The game allows the player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and compares the player's choice with the computer's random choice to determine the winner. The following technologies and libraries are used:

- Python 3
- `random` library for generating the computer's choice

## Source Code
[Source Code](Rock_Paper_Scissors_By_HH.py)

## Live Demo
Unfortunately, a live demo is not possible for a command-line application. However, you can easily run the game on your local machine by following these steps:

1. Download the source code from the provided link.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code file.
4. Run the game by executing the following command:
    ```sh
    python Rock_Paper_Scissors_By_HH.py
    ```

## Inputs and Outputs
### Inputs
- The user is prompted to choose `[r]ock`, `[p]aper`, or `[s]cissors`.

### Outputs
- The game displays the user's choice and the computer's choice.
- The game then announces the result: whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a draw.
